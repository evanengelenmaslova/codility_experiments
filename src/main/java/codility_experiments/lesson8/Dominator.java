/**
 * An array A consisting of N integers is given. The dominator of array A is the
 * value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.
 * 
 * For example, consider array A such that
 * 
 * A[0] = 3 A[1] = 4 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 2 A[4] = 3 A[5] = -1 A[6] = 3 A[7] = 3 The
 * dominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of A (namely in
 * those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than a half of 8.
 * 
 * Write a function
 * 
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 * 
 * that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns index of any element
 * of array A in which the dominator of A occurs. The function should return −1
 * if array A does not have a dominator.
 * 
 * For example, given array A such that
 * 
 * A[0] = 3 A[1] = 4 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 2 A[4] = 3 A[5] = -1 A[6] = 3 A[7] = 3 the
 * function may return 0, 2, 4, 6 or 7, as explained above.
 * 
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * 
 * N is an integer within the range [0..100,000]; each element of array A is an
 * integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
