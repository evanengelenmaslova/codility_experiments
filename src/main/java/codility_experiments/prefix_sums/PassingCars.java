/**
 * A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive
 * elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.
 * 
 * Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
 * 
 * 0 represents a car traveling east, 1 represents a car traveling west. The
 * goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 ≤ P
 * < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the
 * west.
 * 
 * For example, consider array A such that:
 * 
 * A[0] = 0 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 0 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 1 We have five pairs of passing
 * cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).
 * 
 * Write a function:
 * 
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 * 
 * that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the number of pairs of
 * passing cars.
 * 
 * The function should return −1 if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds
 * 1,000,000,000.
 * 
 * For example, given:
 * 
 * A[0] = 0 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 0 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 1 the function should return 5, as
 * explained above.
 * 
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * 
 * N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array A is an
 * integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1.
